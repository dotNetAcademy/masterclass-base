# Solid Fundamentals

## De opdracht

Je kan de opdracht vinden in [Game of Goose Excercise](./GameOfGooseExcercise.pdf).

## Doel van de opdracht

Deze opdracht heeft als doel om de SOLID principles op te frissen in .NET.
Dit doen we op een TDD (Test Driven Development) manier, om zo de kwaliteit van de applicatie te garanderen.

## Code style

### General
A code style is a set of guidelines that help developers write code in a consistent and readable way. A code style can also help prevent common errors, such as missing semicolons, incorrect indentation, or mismatched braces. A code style can be enforced by using tools such as code analysers, code formatters, or code editors that provide suggestions and warnings.

### Some of the benefits of using a code style are:

It makes the code easier to read and understand, which can improve productivity and collaboration.
It reduces the chances of introducing bugs or errors due to inconsistent or unclear code.
It helps maintain a high quality and professional appearance of the codebase.
It can help adhere to the best practices and conventions of the programming language and the framework.
 

‚úã Do use access modifiers

Why? Access modifiers in C# are used to control the accessibility of a class, method, or variable. They help to define the scope of the class, method, or variable and determine which parts of the code can access it. Using access modifiers can help to improve the maintainability of your code by making it easier to understand and modify.
 

### The following access modifiers are available in C#: (Access Modifiers (C# Programming Guide) )

public: The type or member can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it. The accessibility level of public members of a type is controlled by the accessibility level of the type itself.
private: The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct.
protected: The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class, or in a class that is derived from that class.
internal: The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly. In other words, internal types or members can be accessed from code that is part of the same compilation.
protected internal: The type or member can be accessed by any code in the assembly in which it's declared, or from within a derived class in another assembly.
private protected: The type or member can be accessed by types derived from the class that are declared within its containing assembly.
üí° Tip

You should have a compelling reason for every item you make public. If you don't, hide it.
 

‚úã Do use the CodeMaid extension and/or an in-house edit config

Why? Non-formatted code, double whitespaces, unused usings and instances, uneven indentations etc. can make code look 'sloppy' and it's wasted effort in trying to remember all guidelines on whitespaces, braces, etc. per language.
 

A tool like CodeMaid can automate this process and will almost always make code look better. Remember, a good developer is a lazy developer.

### SOLID

‚úã Do try to apply the SOLID guidelines as much as you can

Why? As a DotNet Labs developer, you should have at least a passing knowledge of the SOLID principles. These will help to make your code more readable, testable, expandable and more resilient to change.
 

DotNetAcademy SOLID course https://learn.dotnetacademy.be/index 
Tim Corey course on SOLID  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RwhyZnVRS8&list=PLAaFb7UfyShCoS246UzZJNEiXuD8bg02e&ab_channel=IAmTimCorey

Having troubles applying the SOLID guidelines? That's understandable since the concepts may be challenging to newcomers. Also, an existing codebase with differing coding styles might make it hard to implement these abstract concepts.

At the very least, try to implement the Single Responsibility and Dependency Inversion principles by writing short and focused methods that do one thing and do that one thing well. Try splitting up larger methods into smaller, readable, reusable and testable methods. To implement DI, try using Dependency Injection and avoiding the new keyword as much as possible when consuming Services.

## Clear Intent

### General
In the world of software development, writing code is not just about making the computer understand instructions; it's also about making the code easily understandable for fellow developers. Clarity of intent is a crucial aspect of writing clean and maintainable code.

‚úã Do use clear names for variables and methods

Why? Names like int number, person or methods like Calculate or ProcessData give the reader next to no information about the intent of these objects. As a rule of thumb, one should not have to look at a method body or related code to understand the intent of a function or variable. If you find yourself having the need to write a lot of comments, your code likely isn't very clear in its intent.
 

// Poor naming
int d; // Days passed since last login

bool flag = true;

public double Calculate(int l, int w)
{
    return l * w;
}
// Improved naming
int daysSinceLastLogin;

bool isLoggedIn = true;

public double CalculateRectangleArea(int length, int width)
{
    return length * width;
}
‚ö†Ô∏è Don't use Magic Numbers or Strings

Why? Magic numbers and strings can be a source of confusion for anyone reading the code. Instead, use constants or enumerations to give meaningful names to these values.
 

// Magic number
if (status == 1) { /* ... */ }
// Improved readability using an enum for user status
public enum UserStatus
{
    Inactive = 0,
    Active = 1,
    Suspended = 2,
    // Add more statuses as needed
}

if (status == UserStatus.Active){ /* ... */ }

üí° Consider the var keyword

As a side note, consider not overusing the var keyword. Generally, the var keyword is fine if the type of the object can be inferred on the same line or by reading the value type. Try to avoid it when it's not clear unless one reads the related code.

// Good use of var when the type is clear from the right-hand side
var firstName = "John";
var age = 25;
var prices = new List<decimal> { 10.5m, 20.2m, 15.8m };

foreach (var price in prices)
{
     ...
}

var average = prices.Average();
// Bad use of var when the type is unclear
var result = CalculateSomething();

foreach (var item in GetItems()) 
{
     ...
}
‚úã Do use SRP and short and focused methods

Why? Following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) ensures that each class or method has a single responsibility. This not only improves the modularity of your code but also makes the intent of each component clear. As a rule of thumb, try to keep methods shorter than a screen's length.
 

// Violating SRP
class UserManager
{
    public void UpdateUser(User user) { /* ... */ }
    public void SendEmail(User user) { /* ... */ }
}

// Adhering to SRP
class UserManager
{
    public void UpdateUser(User user) { /* ... */ }
}

class EmailService
{
    public void SendEmail(User user) { /* ... */ }
}
‚ö†Ô∏è Don't use nested conditional logic

Why? Excessive nesting uses a lot of braces and indentantion which might degrade code readability. Use expressive conditional statements and guard clauses to enhance the readability of your code. Avoid nested conditions and aim for a flat structure that clearly articulates the decision-making process.
 

// Nested conditions
if (condition1)
{
    if (condition2)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
// Flat structure with guard clauses
if (!condition1) return;
if (!condition2) return;
// ...
‚úã Do favor Readability Over Cleverness

Why? Code is read more often than it is written. Write code that is easy to understand rather than trying to be overly clever, so prioritize readability for the benefit of yourself and others.
 

// Clever but less readable
var result = x ^ y; // XOR to swap values

// Readable and clear
SwapValues(x, y);
‚úã Do use Dependency Injection to decouple classes

Try to avoid newing up services in other classes as this tightly couples classes together. Use Dependency Injection to decouple classes. This also relieves the class of the burden (dependencies may have dependencies of their own) of having to create it's own dependencies. See the car analogy: A car needs an engine and a collection of tires to drive, but it's not expected to install its own engine, or grow its own tires. These dependencies are provided to the car.
 

List your dependencies at the top of the class as if they were ingredients in a recipes. A user appreciates being told up front what is needed instead of having to provide new ingredients halfway into the cooking process.

 

// Poor example using new
public class PoorExample 
{
    private IMyDependency _dependency;

    public PoorExample ()
    {
        _dependency= new MyDependency();
    }
}

// Even worse
public class AtrociousExample
{
    private IMyDependency _dependency;

    public PoorMyDependency()
    {
        _dependency= new MyDependency(new ConcreteDependencyA(), new ConcreteDependencyB());
    }
}
// Good example using Constructor Injection, the creation responsibility is delegated elsewhere.
public class MyClass
{
    private IMyDependency _dependency;

    public MyClass(IMyDependency dependency)
    {
        _dependency = dependency;
    }
}

‚úã Do use Allman style braces

Why? The Allman style [1] is a popular coding style in C# that involves placing the opening brace of a code block on a new line, and the closing brace on a new line as well. This style is also known as the ‚Äúcurly brace‚Äù style.
The main advantage of using Allman style braces is that it makes the code more readable and easier to understand. It also helps to avoid errors that can occur when braces are not used consistently.

It is generally recommended to use braces even for single-line code blocks. This is because it can help to avoid errors [2] and make the code more consistent.

‚ö†Ô∏è Don't use regions

Why? The #region directive in C# is used to group related code together and make it collapsible in the Visual Studio IDE. Because Visual Studio collapses regions by default, they hide code from other developers so they can't fully understand what the code is doing.
 

Only in (unit)test code it is sometimes ok to use regions, especially when the setup code is to long.
But even then, your first reaction should be to create a 'setup' method.

 

‚úã Do use the dotNET Lab .editorconfig in your solution

Why? An .editorconfig file helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs.
 

see  for more information about the .editorconfig format.

 

‚úã Do enable the build-in dotNET analyzers

Why? To have a consistence coding experience enable the build in .NET analyzers.
 

Add the following block to each *.csproj file.

<PropertyGroup>
    <AnalysisLevel>latest-all</AnalysisLevel>
    <EnableNETAnalyzers>True</EnableNETAnalyzers>
    <EnforceCodeStyleInBuild>True</EnforceCodeStyleInBuild>
    <TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>
</PropertyGroup>
 

‚úã Do use StyleCop.Analyzers in your C# projects

Why? Adding the StyleCop.Analyzers will mark errors in the IDE **while** you are coding. This will help you to spot issue early one and avoid that errors only popup when you build the solution on the build server.
 

Add the following block to each *.csproj file.

<PropertyGroup>
    <AnalysisLevel>latest-all</AnalysisLevel>
    <EnableNETAnalyzers>True</EnableNETAnalyzers>
    <EnforceCodeStyleInBuild>True</EnforceCodeStyleInBuild>
    <TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>
</PropertyGroup>

<PackageReference Include="StyleCop.Analyzers" Version="1.1.118">
    <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
    <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>
</PackageReference>
 

‚úã Do add a Version tag in all your C# projects

Why? The dotNETlab build pipelines will add a unique version number to each build. The format will be 1.0.0.BuildId where BuildId is an incremental build number.
 

Add the following block to each *.csproj file.
<PropertyGroup>
    <Version>1.0.0</Version>
    <AssemblyFileVersion>$(Version).0</AssemblyFileVersion>
    <AssemblyVersion>$(Version).0</AssemblyVersion>
</PropertyGroup>
 

üí° Consider using DotNetAnalyzers.DocumentationAnalyzers in your C# projects

Why? The DotNetAnalyzers.DocumentationAnalyzers will help you to enforce a certain structure of all public classes, methods and properties in your project. Consider this packages when you write a reusable library, so that other developers know how to use your code.
 

Add the following block to each *.csproj file.

<PropertyGroup>
    <TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>
    <GenerateDocumentationFile>true</GenerateDocumentationFile>
</PropertyGroup>

<PackageReference Include="DotNetAnalyzers.DocumentationAnalyzers" Version="1.0.0-beta.59">
      <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
      <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>
</PackageReference>
