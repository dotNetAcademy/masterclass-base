## Checkout needed code
The first steps is to checkout the code to build. Also some *.yml templates are checked out. Those templates concaint the code/steps to run in the pipeline.

We use GitTools to 'calculate' a version number each time the CI pipeline in ran. The version will depend on the branch that is build.
