# Logging 
## General
Logging is the process of recording information about the execution and behavior of a software application. Adding logging to an applications is a must to resolve production issues quickly and efficiently. It will also help a lot while debugging your application. Logging can help you with the following benefits:

- It can help you debug and troubleshoot problems by providing detailed and relevant information about the errors and exceptions that occur in your code.
- It can help you monitor and measure the performance and health of your application by providing metrics and indicators such as response time, memory usage, CPU load, etc.
- It can help you audit and track the activities and events that happen in your application by providing a chronological and traceable record of the actions and changes that affect your data and resources.
- It can help you comply with the regulations and standards that apply to your application by providing evidence and documentation of your applicationâ€™s functionality and security.

:hand: <span style="color:black"> **DO use the LoggerMessage attribute** </span>
<div style="background-color:steelblue;padding:20px;color:white">
Why? This will make the logging faster because .NET will generate highly optimized code.
